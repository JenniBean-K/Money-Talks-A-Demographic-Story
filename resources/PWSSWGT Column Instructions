# Using the `PWSSWGT` Weight in CPS Supplement Data

The `PWSSWGT` variable is used to generate nationally representative estimates from the **Contingent Worker and Work Schedules Supplement (CWS)** in the Current Population Survey (CPS).

## What is `PWSSWGT`?

Each respondent in the CPS represents thousands of people in the population. The `PWSSWGT` value tells you **how many people** each respondent represents in the context of the CWS supplement. You must apply this weight to your analysis to produce accurate, population-level estimates.

## How to Use `PWSSWGT` with Salary Data

### 1. Weighted Average Salary

```python
# Weighted average salary
weighted_salary = (df['SALARY'] * df['PWSSWGT']).sum() / df['PWSSWGT'].sum()
```

This calculates the nationally representative average salary from the supplement responses.

---

### 2. Weighted Median Salary (conceptual)

Weighted medians are more complex:
- Sort the data by salary
- Accumulate the `PWSSWGT` values
- Find the value where cumulative weight reaches 50% of the total weight

(Ask for code help if needed.)

---

### 3. Total Salary for a Group (e.g., Part-Time Workers)

```python
# Total weighted salary for part-time workers
total_salary = (df.loc[df['WORKHOURS'] < 35, 'SALARY'] * df.loc[df['WORKHOURS'] < 35, 'PWSSWGT']).sum()
```

---

### 4. Percentage in Salary Ranges

To calculate the percentage of people earning under $50,000:

```python
under_50k = df.loc[df['SALARY'] < 50000, 'PWSSWGT'].sum()
total = df['PWSSWGT'].sum()
percent_under_50k = under_50k / total
```

## Summary

| Task | Method |
|------|--------|
| Average Salary | Weighted mean using `PWSSWGT` |
| Median Salary | Weighted median (cumulative method) |
| Total Salary by Group | Multiply `SALARY` Ã— `PWSSWGT` and sum |
| Percentage in Ranges | Use weight sums within conditions |

Use these approaches to ensure your findings reflect the full U.S. population, not just the raw survey sample.
