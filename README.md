# Money Talks: A Demographic Story

## Project Overview

"Money Talks" is a data analysis capstine project that investigates how weekly earnings in the U.S. workforce vary across gender, education leve, occupation, and experience. Using weighted statistical analysis ans interactive visualizations, this project identifies persistent pay disparities and highlights roles with the most equitable compensation structures.

## Objectives 

* Analyze salary variation by:
    * Gender
    * Occupation
    * Education level
    * Years of experience
* Identify roles that offer equitable compensation.
* Determine wheter experience consistently correlates with higher pay.

## Key Findings

* Gender Pay Gap: A consistent gender wage gap persists across most occupations, with men typically earning more than women in the same roles.
* Education & Earnings: Higher education levels corralte with significantly higher wages.
* Experience Plateaus: Years of experience do not always result in proportional salary increases; plateaus are common in some fields.
* Weighted Analysis: The use of statistical weights (PSSWGT) helped ensure accurate representation of population-level trends.

## Summmary of Insights

* Gender disparities remain even after controlling for role and experience.
* Education stands out as one of the strongest predictors of income.
* Roles with higher equity ratios are often in lower-paid fields.
* Weighted averages helped avoid misleading conclusions by accounting for population proprotions.

## Recommendations

* Pay Transparency: Encourage employers to publish pay ranges by role and experience.
* Upskilling & Training: Improve access to career advancement through education, certifications, and reskilling programs.
* Regular Equity Audits: Businesses should conduct ongoing compensation reviews to ensure fairness across demographic groups.

## Interactive Visualization

We created an interavtive website that allows users to explore the wage gap by occupation. Users can select a role and instantly see:
* Average weekly earnings for male and females
* Visual wage comparison cahrt
* A dynamically updates pay gap summary.
